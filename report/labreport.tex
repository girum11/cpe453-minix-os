\section{Description of Driver Implementation}
\subsection{Development Environment}
%Your development environment: version of the Minix kernel and type of installation (platform, native vs. bochs, qemu, or VMware).


\subsection{Files modified}
% A list of all ﬁles modiﬁed, and the modiﬁcations (along with why such modiﬁcation was necessary),

\subsection{The code}
% The complete code of your driver.



\section{Driver Behavior}
%A description of the driver’s behavior when running in the system. If possible, include a typescript or screenshot of the driver in action. (The screenshot is easy if you are running a simulator, not easy if you are running a native installation.)


\section{Results}
% A section listing problems encountered, solutions attempted, results obtained, and lessons learned as previous labs.
\subsection{Problems encountered}

\subsection{Solutions attempted}

\subsection{Results obtained}

\subsection{Lessions learned}


\section{Other things (as necessary)}
% Other things as necessary: Remember, the meta-goal here is to convince the reader of the report that you successfully implemented a Secret Keeper device, or, failing that, to convey what you did do and that you learned something useful.
